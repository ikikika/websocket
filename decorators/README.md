## Decorator

- a function applied to something (eg a class) in a certain way
- TS recognise the @ symbol and point to the function after it, but not execute it
- a function that hook into the source code and either extend the function of it or annotate it with metadata
- a decorator is a pattern in programming in which you wrap something to change its behavior
