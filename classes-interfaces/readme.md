## Classes

- Blueprint for objects
- define how objects look like, which properties they have
- make creation of multiple, similiar objects much easier

## Objects

- instances of classes

## Interfaces

- an interface describes the structure of an object.
- use it to describe how an object should look like.
- not a blueprint, just a custom type
- no concrete values
- use to typecheck an object
- often used to chare functionality amongst different classes, not regarding implementation, but regarding structure
